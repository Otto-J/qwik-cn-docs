The purpose of components is to merge data with the JSX template. You use the `{expression}` to inject data into a template. Expressions are placed either as a text node or attribute on an element.

- Bind `data.name` to the `value` attribute of `<input/>`.
- Bind `data.description` to the value of `<textarea/>`.
