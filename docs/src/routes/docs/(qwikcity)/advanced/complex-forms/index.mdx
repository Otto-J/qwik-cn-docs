# Complex Forms

## What are Complex Forms?

Complex forms would typically contain data in a structure that is more than just simple key/value pairs. For example, a list of people who each have their own email, phone and street address. This would essentially be an array of objects.

## Input naming

### Objects

Nested items can be created by seperating the items with `.` (dot) in the name. For example, `person.name` would be converted to `{ person: { name: 'sam' } }`.

### Arrays

Arrays, either top level or nested are created by specifying the zero-based index in the name.  For example `person.pets.0` would be converted to `{ person: { pets: [ 'cat' ] } }`.

### Example

The key to creating a complex form is in the naming of the inputs. Below would be an example of the list described above:
```html
<form>
  <input name="person.0.name" value="Sam">
  <input name="person.0.email" value="sam@complexform.com">
  <input name="person.0.pets.0" value="cat">
  <input name="person.0.pets.1" value="dog">
  <input name="person.0.address.street" value="1234 Example Ave.">
  <input name="person.0.address.city" value="Qwik">
  <input name="person.0.address.state" value="IA">
  <input name="person.0.address.zip" value="00000">
  <input name="person.0.pets.0" value="beaver">

  <input name="person.1.name" value="Bonnie">
  <input name="person.1.email" value="bonnie@hishai.net">
  <input name="person.1.address.street" value="768 Resolution Way">
  <input name="person.1.address.city" value="Jaffa">
  <input name="person.1.address.state" value="IL">
  <input name="person.1.address.zip" value="01948">
</form>
```

#### Output object

The after submiting the form the data would be parsed in an object like this:
```json
{
  "person": [
    {
      "name": "Sam",
      "email": "sam@complexform.com",
      "address": {
        "street": "1234 Example Ave.",
        "city": "Qwik",
        "state": "IA",
        "zip": "00000"
      },
      "pets": ["beaver"]
    },
    {
      "name": "Bonnie",
      "email": "bonnie@hishai.net",
      "address": {
        "street": "768 Resolution Way",
        "city": "Jaffa",
        "state": "IL",
        "zip": "01948"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Using with Actions

Complex forms can be validated using zod$ with routeAction$ and globalAction$. Continuing with the previous examples it would look like this:

```tsx
export const action = routeAction$(
  async (person) => {
    return { success: true, person, };
  },
  // Zod schema is used to validate the FormData
  zod$({
    person: z.array(
      z.object({
        name: z.string(),
        email: z.string().email(),
        address: z.object({
          street: z.string(),
          city: z.string(),
          state: z.string(),
          zip: z.coerce.number()
        }),
        pets: z.array(z.string())
      })
    ),
  })
);
```
