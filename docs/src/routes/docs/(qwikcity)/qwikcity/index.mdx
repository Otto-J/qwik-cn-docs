# Qwik City

While Qwik focuses on Component API, Qwik City contains API to support the component with common server focused features:
- [routing](/docs/routing/): Define your application routes with directory based routing. (Supports both MPA and SPA routing models.)
- [pages](/docs/pages): Render application pages, the main feature of an application.
- [layouts](/docs/layout/): Define common shared page layouts to be reused across pages.
- [loaders](/docs/route-loader/): Fetch data on the server to be used by the component.
- [actions](/docs/action/): Provide a way for the component to request the server to perform an action.
- [validators](/docs/validator/): Provide a way for validating actions and loaders.
- [endpoints](/docs/endpoints/): A way to define data endpoints for your RESTful API, GraphQL API, JSON, XML or reverse proxy.
- [middleware](/docs/middleware/): A centralized way to perform cross-cutting concerns such as authentication, security, caching, redirects, and logging.
- [server$](/docs/server$/): A simple way to execute logic on the server.
- [cache](/docs/caching/): Control caching of your content.
- [env variables](/docs/env-variables/): API to manage reading environment variables, commonly used for keys, in a platform independent way.
- Supports both Server Side Rendering (SSR) for fully dynamic sites as well as Static Site Generation (SSG) to be hosted on static web servers and CDNs.

We call it a **meta-framework** for Qwik. Qwik City is to Qwik, what [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is to React, what [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) is to Vue, [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) to Svelte and [Analog](https://analogjs.org/) is to Angular.

Qwik (core) and Qwik City (routing) solve problems at two layers of abstraction. **Qwik**, focuses on component and state management primitives, while Qwik City brings an **opinionated and performant way to build sites at scale**. We don't want to lock the ecosystem into a single correct way of building sites, in fact we encourage the community to build alternative solutions on top of Qwik.

> While Qwik City is full of useful functionality, thanks to Qwik's resumability and JavaScript streaming, there is no additional cost to the end user from Qwik City. (zero JavaScript);

Use Qwik City to build an e-commerce website, blog site, or any other website that needs routing, layouts, or data retrieval/updates. Qwik City is built on Qwik, and therefore Qwik City sites are resumable and only download the minimal amount of JavaScript with fine-grained lazy loading.

## High Level API Overview

This table shows which file (`index.tsx` vs `layout.tsx`) the respective feature should be implemented in.

## Partytown

Qwik City also comes pre-integrated with [Partytown](https://partytown.builder.io) allowing you to execute your third-party code off the main thread.
