# Caching Responses

Caching responses is critical for keeping your site as fast as possible, both for [pages](/docs/(qwikcity)/pages/index.mdx) as well as [middleware](/docs/(qwikcity)/middleware/index.mdx).

A good default is to use [stale-while-revalidate](https://web.dev/stale-while-revalidate/) caching for all responses. 

For instance, we can add an `onGet` export to our root [layout](/docs/(qwikcity)/layout/index.mdx) (`src/routes/layout.tsx`) like so, to apply good caching defaults site-wide:

```tsx title="src/routes/layout.tsx"
import { component$, Slot } from "@builder.io/qwik";
import type { RequestHandler } from "@builder.io/qwik-city";

export const onGet: RequestHandler = async ({ cacheControl }) => {
  cacheControl({
    // Always serve a cached response by default, up to a week stale
    staleWhileRevalidate: 60 * 60 * 24 * 7,
    // Max once every 5 seconds, revalidate on the server to get a fresh version of this page
    maxAge: 5,
  });
};

export default component$(() => {
  return (
    <main class="mx-auto max-w-[2200px] relative">
      <Slot />
    </main>
  );
});
```

With the above setup we will not only have better performance (pages are always served instantly from cache), but can have significantly decreased hosting costs, as our server (or edge functions) only need to run max once every 5 seconds per page.

## `cacheControl`

Any method that takes a [request event](https://qwik.builder.io/docs/advanced/request-handling/#request-event) can call `request.cacheControl` to set the cache control headers for the response:

```tsx title="src/routes/layout.tsx"
import type { RequestHandler } from "@builder.io/qwik-city";

export const onGet: RequestHandler = async ({ cacheControl }) => {
  cacheControl({
    public: true,
    maxAge: 5,
    sMaxAge: 10,
    staleWhileRevalidate: 60 * 60 * 24 * 365,
  });
};
```

You can also override this as well. For instance, perhaps you have a default caching at the root, but want to disable caching for a specific page, you can override this with nested layouts

```tsx title="src/routes/dashboard/layout.tsx"
import type { RequestHandler } from "@builder.io/qwik-city";

// Override caching for /dashboard pages to not cache as they are unique per visitor
export const onGet: RequestHandler = async ({ cacheControl }) => {
  cacheControl({
    public: false,
    maxAge: 0,
    sMaxAge: 0,
    staleWhileRevalidate: 0,
  });
};

```

You can see the full [API reference](https://qwik.builder.io/api/qwik-city-middleware-request-handler/) of options you can pass to `request.cacheControl`.

## When not to cache

Caching is a good default, but not right for every page all the time. If you have URLs on your site that will show different content to different people - such as pages only for logged in users, or pages that show different content based on the user's location, you should not cache those pages using cache-control headers in the response, and on server side render the contents of those pages on a per-visitor basis.

For high traffic pages that look the same to everyone, such as a homepage, caching is the best thing to do for performance and cost. But for pages only for logged in users, and as a result probably have some degree less traffic, disabling caching may be wise.

You can conditionally change cache behaviors with any logic you like:

```tsx title="src/routes/layout.tsx"
import type { RequestHandler } from "@builder.io/qwik-city";

export const onGet: RequestHandler = async ({ cacheControl, url }) => {
  // Only our homepage is public and should be CDN cached. Other pages are unique per visitor
  if (url.pathname === '/') {
    cacheControl({
      public: true,
      maxAge: 5,
      staleWhileRevalidate: 60 * 60 * 24 * 365,
    });
  }
};
```

## CDN Cache Controls

For even more control on your caching strategy, your CDN might have another layer of cache control headers.

The `cacheControl` convenience method can receive a second argument (set to `"Cache-Control"` by default). You can pass in any string value specific to your CDN such as "CDN-Cache-Control", "Cloudflare-CDN-Cache-Control", "Vercel-CDN-Cache-Control", etc.

```tsx
cacheControl({
  maxAge: 5,
  staleWhileRevalidate: 60 * 60 * 24 * 365,
}, "CDN-Cache-Control");
```

### Missing controls

Some CDNs (such as Vercel Edge) may strip some of your "Cache-Control" headers.

[On Vercel's documentation:](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/caching#cdn-cache-control)
> If you set Cache-Control without a CDN-Cache-Control, the Vercel Edge Network strips s-maxage and stale-while-revalidate from the response before sending it to the browser. To determine if the response was served from the cache, check the [x-vercel-cache](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/caching#x-vercel-cache) header in the response.

So if your CDN strips some cache control headers away by default (like Vercel Edge) and you want the browser to use "stale-while-revalidate" or "s-maxage", you can add another `cacheControl`:

```tsx title="src/routes/layout.tsx"
import type { RequestHandler } from "@builder.io/qwik-city";

export const onGet: RequestHandler = async ({ cacheControl }) => {
    // If you want the browser to use "stale-while-revalidate" or "s-maxage" Cache Control headers, you have to add the second cacheControl with "CDN-Cache-Control" or "Vercel-CDN-Cache-Control" on Vercel Edge 
    cacheControl({
      staleWhileRevalidate: 60 * 60 * 24 * 365,
      maxAge: 5,
    });
    cacheControl({
      maxAge: 5,
      staleWhileRevalidate: 60 * 60 * 24 * 365,
    }, "CDN-Cache-Control");
};
```
