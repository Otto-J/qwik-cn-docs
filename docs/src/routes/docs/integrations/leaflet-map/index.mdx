# LeafletJS Map

Leaflet is the leading open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps.

Leaflet is designed with simplicity, performance and usability in mind. 
It works efficiently across all major desktop and mobile platforms, can be extended with lots of plugins, has a beautiful, easy to use and well-documented API and a simple, readable source code that is a joy to contribute to. [LeafletJS Map Website](https://leafletjs.com/)
